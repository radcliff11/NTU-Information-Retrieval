Module Coverage:  


Project:   
 Objective  
 In this assignment, you will build an information retrieval system for sentiment analysis. In particular, you will  
  1. crawl a text corpus of your interest,  
  2. build a search engine to query over the corpus, and 
  3. perform text classification and polarity detection over it.  
 The system can be about any domain and data you like. For example, it could be a system for social media marketing, political forecasting, healthcare, financial forecasting, or a recommendation system. For more ideas, you can check our project page at sentic.net/projects.
